I'm a Junior year undergrad interested in Federated Learning, ASR systems, HCI. I recently completed my research internship at IIT Delhi under The Marconi Society's Celestini India Program where I worked on developing a solution to increase women safety by detection distress situation in audio signals on mobile platforms.

When I'm not working on my laptop, you're likely to find me reading novels, playing flute, or making coffee.
